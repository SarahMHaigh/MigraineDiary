Sensitivity to visual and auditory stimulation constitute elements of the diagnostic criteria for migraine, and can also occur between headache attacks. However, less is known about sensory sensitivity across the migraine cycle or whether sensory sensitivity can be predictive of migraine-onset. First, we assessed overall sensitivity in visual, auditory, and odor modalities, tactile pain, and motion sickness in 60 individuals with migraine compared to 60 headache free individuals using standardized questionnaires. We found that individuals with migraine reported significantly greater sensitivity in visual and odor modalities and in tactile pain. There were no significant group differences in auditory sensitivity or in motion sickness severity. Second, we assessed visual, auditory, odor, tactile sensitivity, and motion sickness across the migraine cycle by asking 35 individuals with migraine to complete sensory sensitivity questionnaires every day for 30 days. The questionnaires were the same as those used in the first study, except were adapted to focus on sensitivity experienced within the day of ascertainment. 28 participants completed at least half of the required days. 19 participants reported sensitivities the day prior, the day of, the day after, and days outside of the migraine window. The average sensitivity for each modality for each of these days was calculated per participant. Day and sensory modality were compared in the same model. The majority of the participants did not consistently report on their odor and tactile sensitivity and so were excluded from the model. There was a significant interaction between day and sensory modality. Visual sensitivity increased on the day of a migraine compared to the day before and the day after the migraine, but visual sensitivity on the day prior did not significantly differ from other non-migraine days. Motion sickness was reported as only occurring on the day of a migraine and was minimal before and after the migraine day. Auditory sensitivity, on the other hand, significantly increased the day before a migraine compared to other days outside of the migraine day. Auditory sensitivity was reported to be the worst on the day of the migraine. Together, these findings suggest specific types of sensory sensitivity between migraine episodes, and that worsening auditory sensitivity could reflect the changes in neural functioning that precede a migraine. This was despite reports of overall auditory sensitivity being similar in migraine and headache free groups. Therefore, tracking sensory sensitivities over the course of the migraine cycle may help patients to anticipate when their next migraine attack will occur.

Study 1 questionnaire - to establish differences in sensory sensitivities between migraine and headache-free individuals. Contains references to original standardized questionnaires.
Study 2 migraine diary questionnaire - to measure changes in sensory sensitivities the day beofre a migraine, the day or, the day after, and any other non-migraine days. Contains references to the modified standardized questionnaires used.
